```{r}

```



```{r}
ds<-read.csv("fitness.csv")
ds
```

#### RunPulse was read as the factor, so we will convert it into int
```{r}
ds$RunPulse = as.double(ds$RunPulse)
ds
```


### Missing values
#### Oxygen - has complete data
#### RunTime - has three observations missing
#### RunPulse - has three observations (4, 11, 14) missing together with RunTime and five on its own (5, 8, 18,19, 25)
